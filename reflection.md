What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What Worked:

-- This assignment showed me the importance of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in organizing and structuring code.

---> Class Design: Structuring the Computer and ResaleShop classes made the responsibilities of each clear.

---> Keeping data and behavior inside the relevant classes helped create cleaner code.

---> Having dedicated methods for buying, selling, and refurbishing computers made it really clear where I should go for madification.

---> The separate oo_main.py made testing and debugging more straightforward for me.

What Didn’t Work / Challenges:

-- Switching to oop from proceedural was definitely difficult because it required careful planning, particularly in deciding how responsibilities should be distributed between classes and what functions were nessecary.

--->Initially, it was unclear how the inventory should store and manage computer instances, and I am still unsure if my method was the most effective way to do it

--->Ensuring that the refurbish method updated computers correctly without affecting unintended instances was confusing.

Advice for Future Students:

--Understand the Procedural Code First: Before jumping into OOP, make sure you fully understand how the procedural version functions.

--Plan Before Coding: Sketch out class structures and interactions before implementing them. A clear design helps prevent rework.

--Test Incrementally: Don’t wait until the end to test, run small tests as you implement methods to catch bugs early.

--Ask for Help When Stuck: If a concept isn’t clicking, seek clarification early before it starts feeling like you're absolutely stuck and frustrated.

--Follow the Good Coding Practices in the rubric!!
